# Market-research-analysis
Exploring which streets have the most restaurants in L.A, and comparing chains to non-chains food services.

This project's aim was to assist decision makers regarding the opening of a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles, by preparing market research. In order to attract investors, we are interested in providing a clear picture about the current market conditions- specifically: The distribution of foodservice shops across different types of foodservices, as well as across different streets in the city. Also, we would like to know more about the distribution of chain and non-chain shops, and the number of seats in each establishment. Relevant data was extracted from open-source data on restaurants in LA.
